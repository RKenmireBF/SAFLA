### Service Coordination Patterns

#### Sequential Processing
```
Service A ‚Üí Service B ‚Üí Service C
```
- Each service depends on the output of the previous service
- Error in any service stops the entire chain
- Suitable for linear workflows with strict dependencies

#### Parallel Processing
```
Service A ‚îê
Service B ‚îú‚Üí Aggregator ‚Üí Final Result
Service C ‚îò
```
- Independent services execute simultaneously
- Results are aggregated for final processing
- Optimal for independent operations that can run concurrently

#### Fan-out/Fan-in Pattern
```
Input ‚Üí Distributor ‚Üí Service A ‚îê
                   ‚Üí Service B ‚îú‚Üí Aggregator ‚Üí Output
                   ‚Üí Service C ‚îò
```
- Single input distributed to multiple services
- Results collected and aggregated
- Suitable for parallel processing of the same data

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```
Client ‚Üí Circuit Breaker ‚Üí Service
                ‚Üì
            Fallback Service
```
- Monitor service health and response times
- Open circuit when failure threshold is reached
- Route to fallback service or return cached response

## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Configuration
```json
{
  "services": {
    "primary": {
      "server": "safla",
      "tools": ["deploy_safla_instance", "monitor_system_health"],
      "timeout": 60,
      "retries": 3
    },
    "fallback": {
      "server": "safla-backup",
      "tools": ["basic_monitoring"],
      "timeout": 30,
      "retries": 1
    }
  },
  "workflows": {
    "deployment": {
      "steps": [
        {"service": "primary", "tool": "deploy_safla_instance"},
        {"service": "primary", "tool": "monitor_system_health"}
      ],
      "fallback": "basic_deployment"
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Immediate Retry**: For transient network errors
2. **Exponential Backoff**: For service overload situations
3. **Circuit Breaker**: For persistent service failures
4. **Fallback Service**: For critical operations that must complete
5. **Graceful Degradation**: For non-critical operations

### Performance Optimization
- **Request Batching**: Combine multiple requests to reduce overhead
- **Response Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections to reduce latency
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use async operations for better throughput
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track and optimize resource usage

## Task Management

### Workflow Execution
```typescript
interface WorkflowStep {
  service: string;
  tool: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  timeout?: number;
  retries?: number;
  fallback?: string;
}

interface Workflow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  steps: WorkflowStep[];
  parallelSteps?: WorkflowStep[][];
  errorHandling: ErrorHandlingStrategy;
}
