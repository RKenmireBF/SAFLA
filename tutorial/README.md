# SAFLA Hello World Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to use SAFLA (Self-Aware Feedback Loop Algorithm) through the Roo mode system for a complete "Hello World" implementation. We'll use natural mode transitions and built-in capabilities rather than direct MCP tool calls.

### Phase 5: Meta-Cognitive Enhancement
**Mode: üß† Meta-Cognitive Engine**

1. **Add Self-Awareness Capabilities**
   ```
   Request: "Enhance the Hello World system with meta-cognitive capabilities:
   - Self-monitoring of greeting effectiveness
   - Adaptive strategy selection
   - Performance introspection
   - Goal-driven improvement"
   ```

2. **Expected Meta-Cognitive Features**
   - Self-assessment of greeting quality
   - Strategy adaptation based on feedback
   - Performance goal tracking
   - Continuous improvement loops

### Phase 6: Performance Analysis with Performance Scorer
**Mode: üìä Performance Scorer**

1. **Performance Evaluation**
   ```
   Request: "Analyze and score the Hello World system performance:
   - Response time metrics
   - Memory usage efficiency
   - Learning effectiveness
   - User satisfaction indicators"
   ```

2. **Expected Performance Analysis**
   - Quantitative performance metrics
   - Benchmark comparisons
   - Optimization recommendations
   - Performance trend analysis

### Phase 7: Code Review with Code Critic

   ```
   Request: "Perform comprehensive code review of the Hello World implementation:
   - Code quality assessment
   - Architecture evaluation
   - Security analysis
   - Maintainability review"
   ```

2. **Expected Review Outputs**
   - Code quality scores
   - Improvement recommendations

### Phase 8: Final Assembly and Deployment
**Mode: üèÅ Final Assembly**

1. **System Integration and Packaging**
   ```
   Request: "Finalize the Hello World system for deployment:
   - Integration testing
   - Documentation generation
   - Deployment preparation
   - Release packaging"
   ```

2. **Expected Final Deliverables**
   - Complete integrated system
   - Comprehensive documentation
