## Critical Findings

### Theoretical Breakthroughs
1. **Layered Meta-Cognitive Architecture**: Self-aware systems require clear separation between operational, meta-cognitive, and self-modification layers
2. **Multi-Metric Evaluation**: Single performance metrics are insufficient; systems need ensemble evaluation approaches
