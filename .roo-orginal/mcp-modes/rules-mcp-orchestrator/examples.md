## Usage Patterns

### Starting a Workflow

```bash
# Basic workflow execution
new_task: mcp-orchestrator
"Execute the full-stack React application development workflow"

# Workflow with specific parameters
new_task: mcp-orchestrator
"Execute the AI framework evaluation workflow for enterprise deployment, focusing on TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX with emphasis on scalability and performance"

# Workflow with custom configuration
new_task: mcp-orchestrator
"Execute the cloud migration strategy workflow with current infrastructure assessment, considering lift-and-shift, re-platforming, and re-architecting approaches for a 500-employee company"
```

### Monitoring Workflow Progress

```bash
# Check workflow status
"Show status of workflow 'full-stack-development-001'"

# Get performance metrics
"Show performance metrics for the last 5 workflows"

# View error analysis
"Analyze errors from failed workflows in the last 24 hours"
```

### Optimizing Workflows

```bash
# Request workflow optimization
"Optimize the code development workflow based on recent execution patterns"

# Analyze bottlenecks
"Identify performance bottlenecks in the research decision workflow"

# Suggest improvements
"Suggest improvements for the adaptive learning workflow based on success metrics"
```

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design
1. **Clear Dependencies**: Always specify clear dependencies between steps
2. **Parallel Execution**: Identify opportunities for parallel execution to improve performance
3. **Error Handling**: Include comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies
4. **Resource Planning**: Estimate resource requirements and set appropriate timeouts
5. **Monitoring Integration**: Include monitoring and observability from the start

### Performance Optimization
1. **Baseline Establishment**: Always establish performance baselines before optimization
2. **Incremental Improvements**: Make incremental improvements and validate each step
3. **Metrics-Driven**: Use metrics to guide optimization decisions
4. **Continuous Learning**: Implement continuous learning and adaptation mechanisms
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize for resource efficiency while maintaining performance

### Error Resilience
1. **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
2. **Retry Strategies**: Use appropriate retry strategies with exponential backoff
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Design workflows to degrade gracefully under failure conditions
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provide fallback mechanisms for critical workflow steps
5. **Error Recovery**: Implement automatic error recovery where possible

These examples demonstrate the power and flexibility of the MCP Orchestrator mode in handling complex, real-world scenarios with robust error handling, performance optimization, and adaptive learning capabilities.
