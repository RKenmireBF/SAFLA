## Configuration

The mode is configured via `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Core Orchestrator Settings
orchestrator:
  name: "mcp-orchestrator"
  max_concurrent_workflows: 10
  default_timeout: 300000
  retry_attempts: 3
  circuit_breaker_threshold: 5

# MCP Server Dependencies
mcp_servers:
  required:
    - name: "safla"
      tools: ["*"]
    - name: "perplexity"
      tools: ["PERPLEXITYAI_PERPLEXITY_AI_SEARCH"]
    - name: "context7"
      tools: ["resolve-library-id", "get-library-docs"]

# Workflow Templates
workflow_templates:
  code_development:
    phases: ["research", "design", "implement", "test", "review", "optimize"]
    parallel_phases: ["implement", "test"]
  research_decision:
    phases: ["research", "analyze", "generate_options", "assess_risks", "score", "recommend"]
    parallel_phases: ["research"]
```

## Workflow Patterns

### 1. Sequential Orchestration
Perfect for workflows where each step depends on the previous one:

```typescript
const sequentialWorkflow = {
  id: "code-development-seq",
  steps: [
    { service: "mcp-researcher", tool: "technical_research" },
    { service: "architect", tool: "system_design" },
    { service: "code", tool: "implementation" },
    { service: "tdd", tool: "testing" },
    { service: "critic", tool: "code_review" }
  ]
};
```

### 2. Parallel Orchestration
Ideal for independent tasks that can run concurrently:

```typescript
const parallelWorkflow = {
  id: "multi-perspective-research",
  branches: [
    { id: "technical", steps: [/* technical research steps */] },
    { id: "market", steps: [/* market research steps */] },
    { id: "regulatory", steps: [/* compliance research steps */] }
  ]
};
```

### 3. Event-Driven Orchestration
Responsive workflows that adapt to external events:

```typescript
const eventDrivenWorkflow = {
  id: "adaptive-optimization",
  triggers: [
    { event: "performance_degradation", handler: "optimize_performance" },
    { event: "error_threshold_exceeded", handler: "activate_recovery" },
    { event: "new_data_available", handler: "update_models" }
  ]
};
```

## Integration with aiGI Modes

### Input from Other Modes
- **Architect Mode**: System design requirements and specifications
- **Memory Manager Mode**: Historical data and learned patterns
- **Critic Mode**: Quality criteria and validation requirements
- **TDD Mode**: Test specifications and validation frameworks

### Output to Other Modes
- **Code Mode**: Implementation tasks and specifications
- **Final Assembly Mode**: Completed workflow results and documentation
- **Reflection Mode**: Performance metrics and optimization opportunities
- **Scorer Mode**: Workflow execution metrics and quality scores

## Error Handling Strategies

### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern
```typescript
// Automatically opens circuit after 5 consecutive failures
const circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker({
  failureThreshold: 5,
  recoveryTimeout: 60000,
  halfOpenMaxCalls: 3
});
```

### 2. Retry with Exponential Backoff
```typescript
// Retry up to 3 times with increasing delays
const retryPolicy = {
  maxAttempts: 3,
  baseDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 30000,
  strategy: "exponential"
};
```

### 3. Graceful Degradation
```typescript
// Define degradation levels for different failure scenarios
const degradationLevels = [
  { name: "normal", services: ["all"] },
  { name: "reduced", services: ["essential"] },
  { name: "minimal", services: ["critical"] }
];
```

- **Execution Time Tracking**: Monitor workflow and step execution times
- **Resource Usage Monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Error Rate Analysis**: Monitor and analyze error patterns
- **Throughput Measurement**: Measure task completion rates

### Adaptive Optimization
- **Parallel Execution Detection**: Identify opportunities for parallel execution
