## Configuration

### MCP Server Requirements

The MCP-optimized modes require the following MCP servers to be configured:

#### Required Servers
- **safla**: Core SAFLA system integration (always required)

#### Optional Servers
- **context7**: Documentation and API reference integration
- **perplexity**: Real-time research and AI assistance

### Mode Configuration

Each mode is configured in [`modes.json`](./modes.json) with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Display name with emoji",
  "slug": "mode-identifier",
  "description": "Detailed description of mode capabilities",
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  "rulesPath": "Path to mode rules file",
  "mcpServers": ["list", "of", "required", "servers"],
  "capabilities": ["list", "of", "mode", "capabilities"],
  "workflow": {
    "phases": ["workflow", "phases"],
    "mcpIntegration": {
      "server": ["list", "of", "tools"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **SAFLA System**: Ensure SAFLA is properly installed and configured
2. **MCP Servers**: Configure required MCP servers in `.roo/mcp.json`
3. **Node.js**: Required for running integration tests

### Setup Steps

1. **Verify MCP Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Check that MCP servers are properly configured
   cat .roo/mcp.json
   ```

2. **Run Integration Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Test all MCP-optimized modes
   node .roo/mcp-modes/tests/integration_test.js
   ```

3. **Initialize Mode Rules**:
   ```bash
   # The integration test will create basic rules files
   # Customize them as needed for your specific requirements
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Mode Usage

```bash
# Start an MCP-optimized intelligent coder session
new_task: mcp-intelligent-coder

# Use the orchestrator for complex workflow management
new_task: mcp-orchestrator

# Conduct deep research on a topic
new_task: mcp-researcher
```

### Advanced Workflows

```bash
# Research-driven development workflow
new_task: mcp-researcher  # Research the problem domain
# -> Analyze findings and create specifications
new_task: mcp-intelligent-coder  # Implement the solution

## Migration from Standard Modes

Use the migration script to transition from standard modes:

```bash
# Run the migration script
node .roo/mcp-modes/migrate.js

# Follow the interactive prompts to:
# 1. Backup existing configurations
# 2. Update mode references
# 3. Configure MCP server connections
# 4. Validate the migration
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Server Connection Failures**

   - Check network connectivity and server availability
   - Ensure proper authentication and permissions

2. **Mode Initialization Errors**
   - Run integration tests to identify configuration issues
   - Check that all required MCP servers are available
   - Verify rules files exist and are properly formatted

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor MCP server response times
   - Adjust timeout settings in configuration
   - Consider using fallback modes for critical operations

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the logging level:

```json
{
  "configuration": {
    "loggingLevel": "debug"
  }
}
```
